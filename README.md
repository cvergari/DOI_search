# DOI_search


## What it does

This add-on adds a search engine to the browser that links to a Digital Object Identified.
It simply sends the search term to the doi.org website.

## Usage
Copy a DOI (for example: 10.1103/PhysRev.47.777) and paste it into Firefox's search box. If the DOI exists, the linked page will open directly.
